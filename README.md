# Ragas Custom Testset Synthesizer Example

This project contains an example of how to create a custom testset query synthesizer for the [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) library.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to demonstrate the process of subclassing Ragas's base synthesizer components to generate test data tailored to specific needs. In this case, the `test.ipynb` notebook attempts to define an `EntityQuerySynthesizer`.

## `test.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook contains the definition of `EntityQuerySynthesizer`. The intention is to create a synthesizer that generates test questions (`Queries`), relevant document chunks (`Contexts`), and ideal answers (`References`) based on entities extracted from a knowledge source (like a knowledge graph).

**Note:** The implementation within the notebook currently uses placeholder logic for generating scenarios and samples. You will need to replace this placeholder logic with your actual implementation based on your data source and desired test set characteristics.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    You will need `ragas` and potentially other libraries depending on your specific implementation.
    ```bash
    pip install ragas jupyterlab # Add other dependencies as needed
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Start Jupyter Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  Open and run the cells in `test.ipynb`.
3.  **Modify the placeholder logic** in the `_generate_scenarios` and `_generate_sample` methods within the `EntityQuerySynthesizer` class to fit your requirements.
4.  Integrate the custom synthesizer with the Ragas `TestsetGenerator` or use it directly as needed for your evaluation workflow. Refer to the Ragas documentation for details on using custom components.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Import Errors:** The Ragas library structure might change between versions. If you encounter `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`, please consult the official Ragas documentation for the specific version you are using to find the correct import paths for base classes like `QuerySynthesizer`.
